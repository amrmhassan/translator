# a translator for apps languages
 create a en.json file with translation sentences in it at the format
{
  "app name":"App Name Example",
  "greetings":"Hello dear user"
}
 then run the main.dart with the translation folder path like dart ./main.dart "../path-to-folder"
 this folder will contain the translation files next to the en.json file
